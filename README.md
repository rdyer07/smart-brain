This is a face detection app created using React.js on the front end.

To use the app, register your details to create your own profile; an email and password is required for security validation.

Once signed in, find an image with a url and input it into the search bar; the result will display the image and a box will display where the face is located.

It comes with a ranking system where the more image urls you input, the higher your rank will be.

Here is the link to the app - https://smart-brainx.herokuapp.com/

Have fun!
